A repo demonstrating using Django in three different ways.

Firstly, a HTML-only django-forms app. It deals with a lot of formsets.
(master branch)

Secondly, a HTML-mainly django app with pjax. All HTML is rendered server side
and sent via pjax. The result is very snappy.
(pjax branch)

Finally, a django rest framework API + ReactJS front end. When I say ReactJS
I mean it. Redux and react-router were out of scope.
(react branch)
